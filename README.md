Bank Customer Churn Analysis
Welcome to the Bank Customer Churn Analysis project.
This repository contains a full data exploration of a real-world bank dataset using Python.

We examined why customers leave the bank (churn) and uncovered key patterns using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

**Project Overview**
Real-world dataset of over 10,000 bank customers

Goal: Find reasons behind customer churn

Data visualized across features like age, credit score, balance, salary, and more

Identified important trends in customer behavior

**Key Insights**
Customers who are older with high balances are more likely to churn

Many customers maintain a zero balance despite having good credit

Credit score doesn't strongly relate to tenure, salary, or balance

Active credit card users are less likely to leave

Income has a weak influence on churn
